            <h1>Discover Akan Names and Culture</h1>
            <p>Akan names are rich in meaning and tradition. They are often given to children based on the day of the week they were born, as each day is associated with a specific name. 
                For example, a child born on a Sunday may be given the name Kofi, which means "born on Sunday." Akan names also often reflect the circumstances of a child's birth, 
                such as the name Nana, which means "queen" and is given to a child born to a chief or queen mother.</p>
            <p>Akan names also often have spiritual significance, reflecting the beliefs and customs of the Akan people. 
                For example, the name Osei, which means "warrior" may be given to a child who is believed to be strong and brave, or the name Nkrumah, 
                which means "the one who is able to walk on water" may be given to a child with a strong leadership potential.</p>
            <p>Overall Akan names are not only a way to identify a person, but also a reflection of their culture and tradition, 
                it is a way for their heritage to be passed on to future generations.</p>
